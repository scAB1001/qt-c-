QTextBrowser is useful for displaying larger quantities of text.
The content can be supplied as basic HTML, and even hyperlinks are
supported (as in this example) - but note that formatting capabilities
are limited; if you want proper support for HTML, CSS & JavaScript
you will need to use QtWebKit.
